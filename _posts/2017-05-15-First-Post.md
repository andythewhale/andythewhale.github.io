If you're reading this, I have successfully started a blog. So just to get into the groove of things I'll post something about the most recent books I've read. They're sort of related to artificial intelligence and I think they're some of the best books that I've finished so far this year. I'll try to keep this short because I'm annoyed froms setting up the blog. I'll finish edting this stuff at a later date because I forget all the HTML tags and this is going to look like garbage at first.

Book(s):
Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow / Sapiens A Brief History of Humankind
Author: Dr. Yuval Noah Harari
</b>
</p>
<br>

<p>
The books were great. Homo Deus extends on Yuval's critically acclaimed book <b>Sapiens</b>. Sapiens is basically a history of everything style book. But it's more than that. I was blown away by how much I took away from it. Yuval goes really in depth to societal structures and does an awesome job at explaining his hypothesis for how human society was formed and is currently constructed. Usually when reading a book I'm skeptical on the ideas it portays and the biases that the author has. However, in Yuval's text, it's like hearing about history from a neutral perspective. Keep in mind, it's possible that I just agree with the author. Sapiens in my opinion is the superior work. But only because history is one of my favorite subjects to know and understand. Regardless, if you're going to read one of these books, you have to read them both, and you have to read them in order.

Anyway, Sapiens describes the current thesis on humankind. It's origins, it's evolution, and our present day situation. The book does a very good job and everything is described extremely well. The major things I took away from the book were the formations, and relationships that develop among large human populations. The idea for why human beings might be different then other animals (from Dr. Harari's they're the same except for one key point, if that). And the current stories that human beings tell themselves to push the envelop for the development of productivity and society as a whole.

The second novel, Homo Deus, expands on the first book and basically tries to extrapolate on the first book's premises. Which almost literally doesn't mean anything because nobody can predict the future. But Harari is still able to produce good evidence for his theories and ideas. Again, he does such a good job at this to the point where I feel like I'm reading an almost certain future instead of a fictitious expansion. He also continues to restate the themes in the previous book (which is good because there's a lot to take in from the first book). The most exciting thing about the book is Yuval's take on the human end-game theories. They're all interesting and believable ideas. The one I like the most was about humanities increasing necessity for decentralization and the struggle that centralized forces are going to have in the future to uphold their strengths. I also liked a lot of the chatter Dr. Harari had on the increasing need for artificial intelligence. We live in a where where the sum of all people in the world cannot keeo up with increasing amounts of data present in the world. Yuval points out that there needs to be a way to organize and represent data meaningfully or it cannot be used (obvious). But what isn't obvious is that it de-legitimizes central governments. He also points out that we're at the point where we're moving into a world where the population's nuances for how the world is run isn't adjusting fast enough to where we're going. He points out that we're headed for a world where humans (or something more than humans) hold power more disproportionately than they do now. I found the entire book very thought provoking and and very interesting.
