<h3>something cool, I don't know</h3>
<br>
<p>
<b>Neat. </b> This week was pretty good in terms of content. I finished the book Superintelligence by Nick Bolstrom. I finished the book Everybody Lies by Seth Stephens-Davidowitz. CGP Grey, in my opinion, the best Youtuber on interesting topics, released 3 new videos. Casually Explained (dry comedy), released a youtube video. And almost out of our time frame, Exurbia (weird philosophy) released a video.
<p>
<br>

<h4>topics:</h4>
<br>
<p>
So first I'll really shortly review all of this boring content that nobody else cares about, I'll talk about what I think about when I think of them all together (still boring), and then I'll talk about ML and some interesting things that are going on.

<h4>reviews:</h4>

<p>
I don't like myself, but I tend to think the content I look at is the best content in the world. If there's one thing I like about being me it's my ability to know something important/cool when I see it. That being said, a good binge for anyone's life would be to go watch evry single video on the following youtube channels: Exurb1a, CGP Grey, Kurzgesagt, and Casually Explained. All of the content is 10/10 and I don't think I've ever missed a video. Exurb1a lags behind a bit because it's very big picture and content creation is very limited for the scope of the videos. Anyway, watch the videos and then never come back to this blog again.

Right so the books. <b>Superintelligence - Nick Bolstrom </b>. Awesome for me, real dumb for most. It's a philosophy book on AI and machine learning. The book goes over the benefits, challenges, and perils of artificial general intelligence. It's a wide/tall book with about 400 pages. It took forever to read and was soul sucking. I felt like the author was repeating things. I'm glad I read it, I love misery, and the topic were extremely interesting. But I can't help but think that at times the author was just trying to prove that he was smart. <b> Everybody Lies - Seth Stephens-Davidowitz </b>. This book was amazing. Not much to take away from it but it gives a really good eye opening idea of how dumb the world we live in is. The entire book is based on big data analytics of Google searches. It talks about how people lie all the time in person. It does this by looking at Google trends and developing a hypothesis of what people really think based on what they search. And it's genius, because nobody is watching you when you're Googling dumb shit you're too embarrased about to ask other people. A little graphic and vulger at times, but the author is engaging and interesting. The only gripe about the book from my point of view is that it's not technical at all. It's great, but I didn't take much away from it other than a slightly more negative perspective on most human beings. 10/10.

<h4>continued developments</h4>
<br>
<p>
So I've continued to learn things. I went over minimax algorithms and the application of alphabeta pruning to minimax equations. Basically it's how computers can play videogames. They visualize the whole gamespace and calculate almost every possible move. The alphabeta algorithm is applied so that when you have the best possible branch, and you know it, you ignore the rest of the branches so the computer doesn't have to search them. It's pretty neat, but it took me a long time to figre out how to code it because I'm real dumb. I read a paper on Deep Learning and Google Deep Mind's AlphaGo distributed system. Crazy stuff, I didn't understand most of it. Spanish continues to move along slowly. I'm going to get some audiobooks on it because they're cheap and I can multitask with it. Marcus is outside of Sacremento, so I should start working on that project visualizing his locations so that it's all ready to go. It should be pretty straight forward. I'm thinking about getting into web development while I also get into the AI / Deep Learning stuff. I think it would give me a good opportunity to go remote within 2 years so I actually have some mobile freedom. That would be cool.

<h4> climate accord </h4>
<p> 
This next part is about the Paris Climate Agreement. It is meaningless. In regards to what everybody already knows: Global warming is real. There is no negative to staying in the climate agreement as the Paris climate deal is a non-binding agreement. No country is forced to adhere to any policy or regimen, they are only given guidelines. If you violate the guidelines, there is no negative effect. The Paris climate deal's basis was to create a consensus among nations that climate change is a serious issue and that the world needs to work together to prevent it from escalating further. The United States of America, the nation that is supposed to be the cultural and economic leader of the world has exited the agreement. This doesn't mean anything. Not being involved in it just proved that the current administration is amazingly incompetent. Not being in the agreement just leaves the impression that the US is no longer relevent as a mover and shaper of the future. This might not seem like a big deal, but ideas and stories are important. If there's no story to back up that the United States is whatever it claims to be, then it won't be what it is claiming. Getting people to believe in something makes that something a something (1984). Beliefs, true or false, are imporant on the societal level. Any government that doesn't realize that is doomed to fail. The whole not being in the Paris agreement thing is dumb. We as a country should support things that make the world a better place. Making the world a better place increases economic prosparity across the board. What American's value the most is their money, what some American's don't realize is that economics is not a zero sum game. Just because others have more, doesn't mean you have less. If you use your money to create a more productive economy, you can make more money by spending money. <b>Side-Note: </b> Globalization is the future (it's also now but...). Not participating in it makes a country less competitive. It also decreases the total global wealth. It is inhibitory of technology and progress. The US cannot ride on the coatails of its past success forever. Growth, tolerance, and a redistributed investment strategy is necessary if the US plans to stay a dominant force in the world. Honorable mention, a better justice system may also be necessary. And less gerrymandering. And abolishing the electoral college.
