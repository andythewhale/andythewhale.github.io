<b>Ok. </b> Very sub-par content coming up. To the point where I actually have to find the books I've read to to remember what they were.

Let's start with the good? <b>Black Edge - Sheelah Kolhatkar.</b> It's a book about insider trading and just basically gives you a look at the world of doing stuff that is border-line illegal to make money. The story is really good and it's extremely entertaining. But sadly there isn't much to take away from it. It's sort of like, wow here's this one really cool case I didn't know about. But other than that it's just sort of there. It's a long book. 10/10. If you want an awesome story with content, read Flash Boys. <b>40 Ways to be Miserable - Randy J. Paterson</b> This book was so boring. I'm not one for self help books. But it took a different approach so I thought it would be cool. The book basically tells you what not to do to be sad. Honestly, it contradicts itself. I can't say I took away anything from it. I will not be taking the book's advice, but maybe someone else would like it. It's not terrible. I just didn't think anything of the words I was reading. 5/10.
I started reading Peter Norvig's AI textbook. It's dope. The first 25 pages have no content or math but it's pretty interesting from a philisophical standpoint. I am already a fan. 10/10 ... for now. <b> Silicon Valley </b> This season is pretty good, 8/10.

<h4>continued developments</h4>

So I've still continued to learn things. I started a few projects with some outlying groups of cool people on financial / blockchain projects. Other than that I've basically just brushed up on tensorflow, optiization (simulated annealing specifically), adversarial search algorithms, constraints, & logic. Nothing super big to show for it, but I feel like it was a lot of work. <b>I really want to work on some projects where I can get something to show for it by the end of the day. Spanish, yeah, still got it.

<h4>blockchain</h4>
<p> 
I've always been a fan of blockchain and systems that would otherwise be more efficient if their structure were decentralized. Also any tool in general that gives developers more freedom is a pretty neat thing to have. The past couple weeks has seen huge volume increases in the rading of blockchain currencies. There's a lot of arguement and speculation going on over what's going to happen. A lot of experts(?) .. lol) are making pretty bold claims about the future of ethereum and bitcoin. The truth is that nobody knows anything and they don't have solid reasoning to back up their claims. Nobody, not even the smartest people in the world know exactly what's going to happen with blockchain. It's uncharted territory and it's more complex than trying to understand the stock market. These currencies aren't tied to anything and the supply and demand that is generated for them is more than just a sentiment analysis problem. Ethereum is trading at over 2000% of what it was last month. Bitcoin is a bit under 100%. Ethereum isn't a currency. It's an application for developing other applications using smart contracts. And a lot of the demand is being driven by people making their own tokens and selling these tokens as a way to fund whatever project the tokens are going to be used for. Bitcoin doesn't do anything. It's a currency storage system with a fixed number of units. There's nothing more complex about the systems. Some argue that one will dominate the other, some argue that Ethereum will crash, some argue that Bitcoin will fall out of favor. Nobody really knows. It's fun to watch and you should learn about it. Blockchain is a super cool developing technology that people either hate or love. But they shouldn't. It's just there, it should be used as necessary.
