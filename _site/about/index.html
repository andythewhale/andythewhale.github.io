    <p>My name is Andy. I’m a chemical engineer and a programmer. I like helping people, working hard, synthetic biology, machine learning, and running (in that order). I made this blog because I’m super interested in artificial intelligence and deep learning. I think it’s going to change the world. I thought it would be helpful to make a blog. Truth be told, I’m not that great of a programmer, but I want to be. So I’m going to try my best to be a great programmer. I think that it would be helpful for me to blog about how I learn about and get good at deep learning and artifical intelligence. Hopefully nobody will ever look at this page, I mean honestly, it’s horrible, and I’m too lazy to fix anything. Either way, thanks for visiting, and have a great day.</p>
